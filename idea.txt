I am planning to make a online portal and app for victim rescue system.
  There are many nepali foreign workers who get's stuck in foreign country  and get's exploited.
  So our platform works as a information distribution system where people can instantly raise issues and ask for help.
      which includes name, exact location, country, audio or video if possible.
  we will have panel or any effective way for information relaying and faster reachability for different authorities like:
    nepal police.
    nepal embassy in foreign country (every country)
    journalist
    activist
    Human Rights commission
    Women rights commission
    Nepali society groups of respected country (eg: UK society nepal) 
  Features:
    Instant notification to all the authorities.
    Sms to all the authorities.
    Location of victim in map if needed.
    Contact victim (not video or audio call direct number call).
    Victim can view how many authorities have noticed the complain raised  and also can see the response they made. (like a comment where they will tell or ask additional info)
  Public Website:
    How many Case solved.
    How many Case pending.
    Case status and information.
    Credit to the authorities or collaborators.
      Respective Authorities blogs and posts.
      The authorities mentioned above can write blogs and posts and public can view them.
  collaborations:
